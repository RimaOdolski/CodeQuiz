# Javascript Quiz 
## This project is a **work in progress** with the below features: 

Upon clicking on Start, a multiple choice quiz will start. The user has 75 seconds to complete the quiz. The user gets 10 points for each correct answer and the timer decreases by 10 seconds for each wrong answer. The score is highlighted at the top left of the screen. 


# Improvements:
* Make the local storage button dynamic and to only display at the end of the quiz.
* Improve on the responsivness of the page by using either Bootstrap of Media query.
* Improve the styling of the quiz to make it more user friendly. 
* Fix the on click for my choices. Currently, I have to click twice for an event to fire up.
